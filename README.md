# SugarCpp
SugarCpp is a language which can compile to C/C++.
We all known that c/c++ provide very few syntactic sugar.Sometimes we have to write more code to achieve the same functionality.

SugarCpp is designed to write less code and provide more syntactic sugar to reduce the quantity of C/C++ code.It looks like CoffeeScript but can compile to C/C++.

Notice, since SugarCpp is compile to C/C++, so it doesn't include garbage collection.

## Examples

#### Hello world
```
void main()
    printf("Hello world!") 
```
